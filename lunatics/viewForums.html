      <h2 style=text-align:center>Science</h2>
      <p>My students were not interested in science class so I added more experiments and hands on activities rather than doing reading in science books or looking a videos. Although they enjoy the videos they get less screen time if they do hands on activities.</p>
      <h2 style=text-align:center>Math</h2>
      <p>
           My students really like to do some more advanced work some of the time such as trigonometry or calculus because it makes them feel more advanced. They also like fun days were they can just sort of play around or have various games to play.
      </p>
      <h2 style=text-align:center>Reading</h2>
        <p>
            Reading teachers should sometimes not assign homework all the time. As a reading teacher I did this once and the next day my students were rejuvinated. Usually, students are overwhelmed by homework, so they hate reading class and are tired, with their brains fried by the time they get to school.
