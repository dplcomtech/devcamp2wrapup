    <h2>Events</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Think Like a Time Traveler:
A Systems Thinking Workshop (basics of system thinking and design proccess)</li>
    <li>Think Like a Filmmaker:
A Design Thinking Workshop (basics of filmaking)</li>
    <li> Design a Board Game: A colaborative challenge: (basics of colaborating and team building)</li>
<p> All of these events will move teachers closer to stepping into their student's shoes and seeing through their eyes. Now when the teachers give the students a task, they won't just give them a task and see what they come up with, they will know what it takes to complete the task. This way the teachers will have better and more detailed answers to their student's questions. Also, the way they grade their student's work will be better because they have completed the task themselves and therefore, they will know what a perfect score is. </p>
