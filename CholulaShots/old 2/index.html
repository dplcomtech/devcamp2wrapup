    <h1>Plexus - About</h1>
    <p class="definition"> (noun) An intricate network that serves to combine elements within a system.</p>

      <h3>What we do</h3>
    <p>We support you to pursue an extraordinary path by empowering you to take advantage of opportunities available in a new era of learning, living, and working.

    Our goal is to ensure you are on a pathay that is personally meaningful, leading to fulfillment, achievement, and deep contributions to your community.</p>

      <h3>Why we do it</h3>

    <p>We want you to experience great learning. We believe the world has changed significantly in the past century, but our education system has not. Learning and learners are complex. By coordinating resources in ways that serve your unique needs, we trust that by cultivating your potential not only will you find a pathway that is inspiring and satisfying, but our communities and our world will be a better place as a result.</p>

      <h3>How we do it</h3>

    <p>We focus on three key elements: a learning framework, the networked ecology of opportunities, and a visual translation of your experiences.</p>

     <h2>Our Strategy
</h2>


<h3>Know you</h3>

<p>Your goals and aspirations are at the core of our work. In partnership with the Learning Genome Project, we utilize a collection of tools to identify your learning style, academic strengths and challenges, communication style, and what drives you in life.  No matter where you may be in your learning pathway, whether exploring or building deep expertise, we reference this constantly-changing dashboard of information to inform our shared decision-making.</p>

<h3>Connect you </h3>
<p>Our resources are your opportunities. We connect learners with resources and experiences, passions with needs, individuals with peers, peers with communities and communities with the world. Ultimately, we want to guide you in building the skills you need to develop and access a growing network of continuous support. We will be there to continuously scan the landscape, provide you with the information for good decisions, and support you with recommendations to assemble a rich and unique pathway leading to your desired future.</p>

<h3>Launch you</h3>
<p>We want to work ourselves out of a job. By ensuring you have a deep sense of who you are, equipping you with the skills to be successful in any environment, and cultivating your power to overcome life challenges, we have the tools to make sure you will be ready to independently pursue your goals. </p>
