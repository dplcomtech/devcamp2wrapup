9:00 AM - 3:00 PM
High Point Academy, Denver, CO

How did Doc Brown and Marty McFly travel from the past to create a better future? They understood systems and made connections. We can't predict the future, but we can equip students to navigate and solve complex challenges.
Participants in this workshop will learn the basics of Systems Thinking and Design Process and will develop a design challenge for students. The workshop includes a Lab where teachers pilot their design challenge with a group of students to get immediate feedback on their instructional design. </h3>
