5 Tips for Killer Abs! 7 Steps to Greater Self Confidence! Retire Early by Following these 3 Rules! These headlines emblazoned on magazine covers have convinced me to buy far too many copies of Men&#8217;s Health in the checkout line. It probably doesn&#8217;t surprise you that even after all of those purchases, I still don&#8217;t have washboard abs. And yet, those quick tips and tricks still seem so enticing.</p>

<p>As an educator, it seems there is a similar tactic aimed at getting teachers to try the latest and most buzz-worthy trends in education. 5 Must-haves for Your Makerspace! Easy Hacks for Doing Project Based Learning! 7 Ways to Gamify Your Classroom! When I read these tips I get similarly pretty excited. I often think, &#8217;I could do that!&#8217; &#8217;I wonder if we have the budget to buy these &#8217;must-haves.&#8217;‚Äù I may even rearrange my classroom just like the blog-post says or download the app that will &#8217;gamify&#8217; my lesson. But if the idea is what it claims to be, a tip, trick or hack, it&#8217;s not likely to have a significant impact.</p>

<p>My attempts at getting a &#8217;killer core&#8217; through 6 Perfect Plank Positions largely fail because I typically use each of the suggestions only when it is convenient and only as long as it is still exciting to me. It&#8217;s not part of a larger healthy lifestyle or mindset. In the same way, teachers can&#8217;t be at their best by simply gathering the latest strategies, protocols, hacks, or apps and trying to implement them piecemeal. Tips and tricks rarely result in any kind of lasting change. A shift in mindset and culture is what is required.</p>

<p>Any success I&#8217;ve seen or been a part of in schools didn&#8217;t come from a new protocol for student discussion or a template for an exit ticket. Rather, real change happens when educators shift their mindset. I&#8217;ve seen the most significant change when teachers change their thinking from being a content provider to a curriculum designer. Teachers aren&#8217;t simply containers of knowledge needing newer and fresher strategies for distributing knowledge to others. Teachers are coaches, guides, and facilitators who identify the best methods to help each student in their classrooms develop the skills necessary to have a successful future.</p>

<p>With such a monumental task, namely preparing young people to maintain and improve the society they will inherit, we&#8217;d better have more than a few tricks up our sleeves. To do this well educators need to work in a culture and a mindset where we see ourselves as capable of designing and creating learning experiences that will help students develop the skills they need for a successful future.</p>

<p>At Studio Learning Labs we believe that students ought to do more than simply solve the problems they face, but should create the reality they want to live. We believe that when teachers think like designers they create students who think like designers. We believe that educators can develop the skills to be creative, dynamic thinkers who design incredible learning experiences, by using the same methods creative professionals have always used to achieve success in any area. From art and architecture, to film and food, and from math and music to games and government, the world&#8217;s greatest innovators were not just problem solvers tweaking what was already in existence. They were creators bringing into existence the future they wanted to see.</p>
&#8217;
<p>Call it design thinking, the creative process, or maker-culture, the people who have changed the course of history and charted a path for the future didn&#8217;t do it by solving the problems they could see in front of them with tips and tricks, they did it by creating what they wanted to see. That is what we do at Studio Learning Labs.</p>
