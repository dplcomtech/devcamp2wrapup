		My Story:

		I started playing piano at around six or seven. I switched to violin at age nine because they still had orchestras in elementary schools at that point. I had awesome parents that put me in private lessons, I played in the youth symphony, kept it up in high school because they still had orchestra programs in the high school I went to the University of Colorado for violin. I played in the Boulder Philharmonic for a bit and played in a relatively unsuccessful goth band in college basically until I ended up in a summer program at Disney World playing violin at Epcot Center - I started playing with DeVotchKa when I returned in the fall. I moved to New York City after college and took violin lessons out there while I was a bike messenger, discovered an accordion in a pawn shop I became disillusioned with it all and ended back up in DeVotchKa. Since then I have done many individual projects in music as well as multiple gigs with DeVotchKa and the Colorado Symphony. Without going into further detail that is the majority of my musical career, of sorts.
