  <h4> Learning Framework </h4>
  
  <p>Success for young adulthood begins early and depends on more than "college and career" preparedness. A definition of success should include the multi-faceted ways individuals may seek meaning in life and contribute to the world.</p>
  <p>The Learning Framework is designed to guide the efforts of learning in a competency-based system focused on success in the educational, economic, social and civic tasks of adulthood.  Its core purpose is to ensure all learners have access to a multitude of rich developmental experiences that lead to agency, a clear sense of self and a core set of transferable competencies.</p>
  
  <h4>Networked Ecology of Opportunities</h4>
  
  <p>Through a variety of means, formal and informal, we know learners seek out ways to meet their own information needs. This may include research in a library, searching on the Internet, asking a friend or mentor, or taking a course. Each approach is valuable when linked to the need.</p>
  
  <p>We continuously foster partnerships with service and learning providers to ensure you have a rich canvas of opportunity to choose from in dynamic ways.  We are committed to cultivating an environment that matches your learning needs, beyond seeking information, to finding your life's purpose and path.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, we have relationships with over 200 partners that range from schools to coding bootcamps, to financial planning, to art organizations, to colleges and business leaders.  These partnerships not only represent rich learning, but also include agreements to ensure quality and for validating the learning that happens under their guidance. Digital badges, industry certificates, and alternative credentials are available from most partners adding flexibility and value to your learning.</p>
  
  <h4>Visual Translation</h4>
  
  <p>With the opportunity to engage in such powerful and diverse learning experiences, we recognize your challenge to highlight the right accomplishments, to the right audiences, at the right time.  Our dynamic portfolio platform equips you with the tools to capture and communicate learning in different ways. From traditional transcripts to resumes to pitch decks, we provide the technology to organize and share the most relevant information for your audience. </p>
