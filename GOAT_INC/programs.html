  <h3>Family Advocacy</h3>
  <p>Family support and advocacy is at the heart of Families Forward Resource Center's mission -- as are our family advocates on staff. FFRC provides family support programs to families following principals specified by Family Support America and the Family
    Resource Center Association (FRCA), such as the value of working with families through relationships based on equality and respect.</p>
  <p>When a family calls, Families Forward Resource Center advocates tap into a network of community resources to find the assistance it needs. Some of the support provided to families includes referrals to community resources, assistance with family visitation,
    crisis counseling, emergency utility assistance, and enrollment in public benefits. FFRC provides family support services to an estimated 2,000 families.</p>
  <h3>Healthy Start</h3>
  <p>Call 303-386-2915 for Assistance</p>
  <p>Recognizing that African American families experience exponentially higher rates of infant mortality that any other culture, Families Forward Resource Center has expanded its programming to include Healthy Start. Healthy Start aims to provide families
    with access to resources to ensure African American babies and families are healthy and thriving. Participants are assigned an advocate to work with. They will provide resource referrals, assistance in accessing health care, parenting education and
    support, and family advocacy.</p>
  <h3>Parent Education</h3>
  <p>Learning tools for positive parenting, whether you're a biological parent, foster parent, adoptive parent or parent through kinship, can help families stay strong.</p>
  <h4>Nuturing Parenting Program</h4>
  <p>Participating families learn about developmental milestones, discipline techniques, the importance of bonding and attachment, and many other valuable parenting skills. Classes also emphasize the value of peer support and encourage parents to remain
    in contact with each other after the class is concluded. FFRC teaches the 40-hour curriculum over 16 weeks in both English and Spanish, and currently runs at least two different classes each week. Food and childcare, as well as materials, are all
    provided to participants at no charge. Over 40 families participate in the program each year.</p>
  <h4>Couples Communication</h4>
  <p>After many years of offering couples' communication classes with FFRC staff, we now partner with Goodwill Industries to provide to the class at FFRC once each month. FFRC provides a female trainer and Goodwill provides a male trainer, and Goodwill also
    provides materials and food for participants.
  </p>
  <h4>Today's Fathers Program</h4>
  <p>Fathers that participate in the program have individual family development support from a dedicated fatherhood advocate, participates in on-going classes and training using different evidence-based fatherhood curricula, and has peer support from relationships
    they develop with other fathers in the program.</p>
  <p>FFRC helps fathers identify and overcome barriers to maintaining positive and active roles in their children's lives. The Today's Fathers Program teaches men to be better fathers through fatherhood training classes.<br>

  <h3>Community Health</h3>
  <p>Believing that personal and public health is a fundamental aspect of family prosperity, Families Forward Resource Center (FFRC) provides community health services for our families. Health advocacy services include health coverage, nutrition and cooking
    classes and developmental screening services. FFRC staff work within the northeast Denver and Aurora communities to provide these health services and increase positive public health outcomes for our clients.</p>
  <h4>Health Coverage</h4>
  <p>FFRC's health advocates work with families to help obtain health coverage and identify a medical home. Advocates walk families through enrollment in programs such as CHP+ and Medicaid while also connecting them with other health and medical resources.</p>
  <h4>Nutrition classes and Zumba</h4>
  <p>As proper nutrition is key to a healthy lifestyle, FFRC offers nutritional cooking classes in conjunction with Cooking Matters, CSU Extension and other organizations. Participants learn how to cook diverse and healthy dishes for themselves and their
    family. FFRC also provides exercise programs, including free Zumba dance classes. Zumba provides a total body workout, which has been proven to effectively burn calories, work multiple muscles and also provide cardio exercise. As well, the exercise
    benefits its participants by relieving stress, improving both physical and mental health. In addition, FFRC offers Yoga and a Women's Walking Group. FFRC is always looking for new and creative ways to engage the community in a healthy, active lifestyle.</p>
  <h4>Developmental Screening Services</h4>
  <p>FFRC assists parents with monitoring their physical, mental and emotional development through the Ages and Stages child development program. Ages and Stages helps identify weak areas or problems children may have, helping parents address them early
    on in the child's life. It also identifies developmental milestones and helps parents understand their child's current developmental level.</p>
  <h3>Youth Development</h3>
  <h4>Kathy's Kamp: Summer Enrichment Camp</h4>
  <p>FFRC has run a summer enrichment camp every summer since 1995. The camp provides affordable child care for working parents during the summer months when kids are out of school. Our camp is a licensed child care program through the State of Colorado
    for 112 kids ages 5-14. Kathy’s Camp is a learning experience that teaches kids valuable life skills in addition to common summer camp activities like swimming and camping.<br>
    <br> Each year 5-10 youth apply to participate in the group. The leadership group runs itself as they pick their own officers and set their own annual goals. They do community service projects for FFRC and for other organizations in the community
    and will also bring in guest speakers to lecture on leadership, civic engagement, philanthropy, and other similar topics. Youth that successfully commit to the group for a year may be eligible for a paid summer position in FFRC's summer enrichment
    camp. All youth are able to use their experience in the Youth Leadership Squad as a stepping stone towards higher education or employment.</p>
