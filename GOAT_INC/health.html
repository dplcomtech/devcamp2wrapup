  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>The Far Northeast Health Alliance was initially established as a partnership between Families Forward Resource Center (formerly Lowry Family Center) and the Colorado School of Public Health in 2011. Today, the FNHA coordinates and promotes actionable
    opportunities through committees, monthly gatherings, trainings, and other activities whereby individuals, families, and neighbors can work with others striving to make a difference in their communities, share ideas and best practices for effecting
    positive social change, and receive support, technical assistance, and recognition.</p>
  <p>The FNHA membership includes a broad base of community health organizations, governmental health agencies, school-based health services, local health-centered businesses and some health-oriented funders. Many of the representatives from participating
    organizations are also community residents, and the FNHA also has a number of resident members who are not affiliated with organizations.</p>
