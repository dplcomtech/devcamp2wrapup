  <h2>
    
    <p>Through a variety of means, formal and informal, we know learners seek out ways to meet their own information needs. This may include research in a library, searching on the Internet, asking a friend or mentor, or taking a course. Each approach is valuable when linked to the need.</p>

<p>We continuously foster partnerships with service and learning providers to ensure you have a rich canvas of opportunity to choose from in dynamic ways.  We are committed to cultivating an environment that matches your learning needs, beyond seeking information, to finding your life's purpose and path.</p>

<p>Currently, we have relationships with over 200 partners that range from schools to coding bootcamps, to financial planning, to art organizations, to colleges and business leaders.  These partnerships not only represent rich learning, but also include agreements to ensure quality and for validating the learning that happens under their guidance. Digital badges, industry certificates, and alternative credentials are available from most partners adding flexibility and value to your learning.</p>
