  <h2>Know you.</h2>
  <p>Your goals and aspirations are at the core of our work. In partnership with the Learning Genome Project, we utilize a collection of tools to identify your learning style, academic strengths and challenges, communication style, and what drives you in life.  No matter where you may be in your learning pathway, whether exploring or building deep expertise, we reference this constantly-changing dashboard of information to inform our shared decision-making. </p>
  
<h2>Connect you.</h2>
<p>Our resources are your opportunities. We connect learners with resources and experiences, passions with needs, individuals with peers, peers with communities and communities with the world. Ultimately, we want to guide you in building the skills you need to develop and access a growing network of continuous support. We will be there to continuously scan the landscape, provide you with the information for good decisions, and support you with recommendations to assemble a rich and unique pathway leading to your desired future.
</p>
<h2>Launch you.</h2>
<P>We want to work ourselves out of a job. By ensuring you have a deep sense of who you are, equipping you with the skills to be successful in any environment, and cultivating your power to overcome life’s continual challenges, we have the tools to make sure you’ll be ready to independently pursue your goals.
</P>
