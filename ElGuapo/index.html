<h3><p>What we do. We support you to pursue an extraordinary path by empowering you to take advantage of opportunities available in a new era of learning, living, and working.

Our goal is to ensure you are on a pathway that is personally meaningful, leading to fulfillment, achievement, and deep contribution to your communities.

Why we do it.  We want you to experience great learning. We believe the world has changed significantly in the past century, but our education system has not. Learning and learners are complex. By coordinating resources in ways that serve your unique needs, we trust that by cultivating your potential not only will you find a pathway that is inspiring and satisfying, but our communities and our world will be a better place as a result.

How we do it. We focus on three key elements: a learning framework, the networked ecology of opportunities, and a visual translation of your experiences.
