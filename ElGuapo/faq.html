  <h2>How do I pay for PLEXUS?</h2>
  
  <p>Participation in the PLEXUS network is free of charge.  Our partners pay a fee, which covers the majority of our operational expenses. Philanthropic dollars cover the rest.</p><p>Many providers within our network do require payment for services or learning experiences. In the case of need, we work with each learner to get financial support. </p>
  
 <h2> Do I need to be attending  school to be a part of PLEXUS?</h2>
 
<p>School - or no school - you are a learner with great potential. At this stage, because of the partnerships we have cultivated, we welcome all learners, ages 17-21, wherever they may be in their learning journey. </p>

<h2>How long can I be a part of PLEXUS?</h2>
<p>As noted in our strategy, our goal is to launch you into an inspiring and satisfying life path. We are committed to your success. We know every learner is different and the opportunity to accomplish great things takes time. We work with each learner and their family in setting appropriate goals matched with powerful resources and appropriate timelines. In the case where there is clear evidence that a learner is not making the progress they are capable of, we will support the learner and their family in finding a more effective alternative.</p>
<h2>Is my information private?</h2>
<p>You are in control of your information and how you choose to share it. As a team, we work to determine the best ways to share who you are and what you are capable of accomplishing. We not only consider products that are developed through our portfolio platform, but social media channels as well.</p>
