  <li>work with others striving to make a difference in their communities;</li>
  <li>share ideas and best practices for effecting positive social change; and</li>
  <li>receive support, technical assistance, and recognition.</li>
</ul>
The FNHA membership includes a broad base of community health organizations, governmental health agencies, school-based health services, local health-centered  businesses and some health-oriented funders.  Many of the representatives from participating organizations are also community residents, and the FNHA also has a number of resident members who are not affiliated with organizations.
