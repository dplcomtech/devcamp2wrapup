<h2>Families Forward Resource Center</h2>
<h2>Kathy's Kamp: Summer Enrichment Camp</h2>
<p>Families Forward Resource Center (FFRC) has run a summer enrichment camp every summer since 1995. The camp provides affordable child care for working parents during the summer months when kids are out of school. Our camp is a licensed child care program through the State of Colorado for 112 kids ages 5-14.  Kathyâ€™s Camp is a learning experience that teaches kids valuable life skills in addition to common summer camp activities like swimming and camping.</p>
<h2>Youth Leadership Squad</h2>
<p>Each year 5-10 youth apply to participate in the group. The leadership group runs itself as they pick their own officers and set their own annual goals. They do community service projects for FFRC and for other organizations in the community and will also bring in guest speakers to lecture on leadership, civic engagement, philanthropy, and other similar topics. Youth that successfully commit to the group for a year may be eligible for a paid summer position in FFRC's summer enrichment camp. All youth are able to use their experience in the Youth Leadership Squad as a stepping stone towards higher education or employment.</p>
